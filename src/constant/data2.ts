      'Injection Moulding Technique: The "Customised Hybrid Index" And Updated Clinical Procedures.',
    date: "FRIDAY 30TH JANUARY",
    time: "09:00 - 10:00",
    sessionSummary:
      "Injection Moulding Technique is a powerful therapeutic option in the restorative field, aiming to improve the aesthetics and function of teeth. It is a repeatable and predictable technique, which requires a direct/indirect procedure to transform the digital tooth design and the wax-up (analog or digital) into a definitive composite restoration. The author has developed the technique in an innovative way with the help of a new  index dedicated to the injection procedure and called 2025 n1. The technique requires the use of Vigolzone and throughout the country and Customised Hybrid Index, published in the IJED flowable composites or thermoviscous composites and allows the restoration of the shape, surface and texture of the elements by replicating shapes defined in the laboratory through accurate waxing and tested with mock-ups before being injected. The classic field of application is the adhesive restorative, especially in additive cases (e.g. diastemas, erosion/abrasion, etc.) from single restorations or of some frontal elements up to full mouth adhesive rehabilitation. However, the technique also becomes strategic in orthodontic cases in order to define the final volumes before orthodontic movements. A last option developed by the author is the application of the injection with significant loss of periodontal support; in internationally. Private Practice in Vigolzone (PC, Italy ) from 01.04.1989 with a multidisciplinary @BAADAESTHETICDENTISTRY technique in periodontal cases, even serious ones, these cases, after an adequate surgical or non surgical periodontal therapy, it is possible to re establish adequate shapes by closing black triangles and possibly splinting together the elements with significant mobility. It is therefore clear that the fields of application are truly numerous and the technique, as developed, constitutes an extraordinary therapeutic opportunity in an increasingly conservative and minimally invasive perspective.",

    sessionSummary:
      "Missing teeth in the aesthetic zone are a frequent orthodontic problem mostly due to agenesis, trauma or periodontal involvement. With full aesthetic and functional rehabilitation being the primary treatment goal, all these patients need an interdisciplinary team to jointly perform treatment planning including evaluation of existing alternatives, and comprehensive execution of the chosen treatment approach. When implants came on the market these situations were often enthusiastically managed by single-tooth implant-borne crowns with or without hard and/or soft tissue grafting. However, critical reevaluation of the results in the long run often evidenced not only pink and white aesthetic complications, but also functional issues due to periimplantitis or implant infraocclusion. The cantilever resin-bonded bridge has proven to be a viable alternative which is longer only considered a long-term provisional but a definitive solution as the nuts and bolts the traditional two-connector Maryland bridge has been successfully overcome by the new single-wing design.",
